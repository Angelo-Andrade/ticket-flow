### TicketFlow

This project aims to develop a ticket management system for the Information Technology Section of the 28th Mechanized Infantry Battalion of the Brazilian Army. The initiative arises from the need to improve communication between users and the support team, which currently uses a free messaging app, resulting in a lack of control and prioritization of requests.

The TicketFlow system will allow the structured creation and tracking of tickets, facilitating categorization and automatic prioritization based on urgency and impact. In addition, the system will include real-time notifications about the status of tickets, a control panel for the IT Officer, and tools for generating performance reports.

The implementation of TicketFlow aims to eliminate communication noise, increase the efficiency of IT services, and reduce response time for urgent problems. This is expected to lead to a significant improvement in the operation of the Military Organization and user satisfaction. The project represents an innovative solution that seeks to transform the technical support experience, promoting a more productive and effective work environment.

**Used Tecnologies:**
The system was made in Model View Controller architecture, using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS for FRONT-END and NodeJS for BACK-END. The tecnology used to store the tickets and users information was the relational database MySQL and the memory based database Redis.
